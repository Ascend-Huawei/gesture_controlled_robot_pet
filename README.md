# Hand Gesture Controlled Robot
Consider having a pet that is smart, responds to your commands without training, and even takes pictures for you! You don’t even have to pick up after or buy kibble for this pet! This is a dream come true for those craving an animal companion but cannot afford the time, money, or maintenance required for real animals. Robot pets are one example of how technology can assist in scenarios where companionship and fun are needed, but the handling and upkeep of real pets isn’t possible; especially in healthcare or senior homes. 

Apart from doing normal pet things such as moving around and performing a few tricks, it can also perform robot tasks, like capturing photos with the camera in its nose. It can also communicate its mood through animated eyes on a colored LCD screen mounted to its head.

Through its camera “eyes”, this robot pet uses a combination of machine learning and computer vision to see and respond to commands given through its owner’s hand gestures. The robot pet can track, recognize, and perform a task such as following the user while video capturing. The user is thus able to control the pet from a distance, enabling full autonomy.
