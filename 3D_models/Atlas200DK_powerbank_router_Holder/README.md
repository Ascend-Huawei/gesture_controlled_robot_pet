4. router_holder: The holder of router, can be inserted into the bottom holder of the power bank

Instructions on assembly: The bottom level is the router_holder which can be either screwed in or glued on to the RC car base. The middle level is the power_bank_holder which has two rectangular holes that can be inserted on top of the router_holder. The top level is the DK_holder_bottom which also acts as the cover of the power bank. It should be put on after you place the power bank and the DK board goes on top. 

Remember to leave all ports facing to the back of the robot so that all cables can fit.
